For Feature Parity
------------------

- Add tab name completion
- Start calculating the chat response speed
- Start evaluating the various scripts that can be sent through chat 
  - Despite being a bad idea, we don't want closing a window to fail
- Check for invasions
- Initial commands
- Various command aliases
  - /help
  - /?
  - /who
- Initial pop message
- Clickable usernames
- Joining other channels
- Changing to other channels
- Ignore chat history when entering for the first time

Cool Additions
--------------
- Parse the incoming player list for various tidbits (like if they're
  admins or PHs and away status)
- Online list change based messages
  - i.e. -- PlayerName Departs --, -- PlayerName Joins --, PlayerName's
    Title Changed
- Support player scripts (see about using the old API, or at least 
  providing compatability with it)
- Intelligent communication with server
  - When checking tabs that aren't open, don't poll every 4 seconds.
    Instead, aim for double that time *until* a new message is actually
    received, then check double or triple that.
- Add a /join command
- Channel-based private communication
- Player filtering (i.e. ignoring a player)
- Saving chat (or sections of it) to a file
- Keep an input buffer for each channel
